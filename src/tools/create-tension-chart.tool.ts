## Core Structural Elements

### Desired Outcome (Vision)
${chart.desiredOutcome}

### Current Reality (Starting Point)
${chart.currentReality}

### Due Date Target
${new Date(chart.dueDate).toLocaleDateString()}

### Strategic Action Steps
${chart.actionSteps.map((step, index) => `${index + 1}. ${step}`).join('\n')}

## Structural Tension Analysis

**Creative Force**: The gap between your current reality and desired outcome creates natural tension that wants to resolve by moving toward your vision.

**Advancement Pattern**: This chart establishes an advancing structure where:
- Each completed action step flows into current reality
- Progress builds momentum for continued advancement
- Success creates new structural tension for next level outcomes

## Chart Usage Guidance

**Daily Practice**: 
- Hold both vision AND current reality clearly in awareness
- Feel the natural tension - this is your creative power
- Trust that actions will naturally emerge from this tension

**Progress Tracking**:
- Complete action steps and update current reality
- Notice how completion changes the structural dynamic
- Celebrate advancement and set new tension for continued growth

**Next Steps**:
- Use \`track-chart-progress\` to monitor advancement
- Use \`telescope-action\` to break down complex steps
- Use \`update-chart\` to refine vision or reality as needed

## Integration with Creative Process

This chart complements your creative phases:
- **Germination**: Chart captures initial creative excitement and vision
- **Assimilation**: Chart maintains structural tension for momentum building
- **Completion**: Chart guides you to successful fruition of desired outcome

**Remember**: This is not a to-do list. It's a structural tension system that naturally generates the energy and actions needed for creation.`;

  if (detectedProblems.length > 0) {
    return `ðŸŒŠ **Creative Orientation Issue Detected**

Your desired outcome contains problem-solving language: "${detectedProblems.join(', ')}"

**Structural Tension Charts** work with creative orientation - what you want to bring into being, not problems to eliminate.

**Reframe Suggestion**: Instead of focusing on what you want to fix/stop/prevent, describe the positive outcome you want to create.

Example:
- Instead of: "Fix our communication problems"
- Try: "Establish clear, effective communication practices"

Please reframe your desired outcome in terms of what you want to create or bring into existence.`;

  );
  
  if (detectedActions.length > 0) {
    return `ðŸŒŠ **Current Reality Clarity Issue**

Your current reality contains future-oriented language: "${detectedActions.join(', ')}"

**Current Reality** should describe what IS now, not what you plan to do or think you should do.

**Objective Description**: State facts about your present situation in relation to your desired outcome.

Example:
- Instead of: "I need to learn programming"
- Try: "I have no programming experience but am interested in learning"

Please describe your current reality as objective facts about where you are now.`;

- "Next Friday"`;

Analyze this structural tension chart for:
1. **Creative Orientation Quality**: How well does the desired outcome focus on creation vs problem-solving?
2. **Current Reality Clarity**: How objective and specific is the current reality description?
3. **Structural Tension Strength**: How clear is the gap that will generate creative energy?
4. **Action Step Strategic Value**: How well do the action steps serve as intermediary outcomes?
5. **Advancement Potential**: What advancing patterns could this chart generate?

Provide specific suggestions for strengthening any weak elements.`;
