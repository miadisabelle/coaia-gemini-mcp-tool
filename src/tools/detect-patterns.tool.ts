function buildOscillationDetectionPrompt(): string {
  return `ðŸŒŠ **OSCILLATION PATTERN DETECTION**

**Definition**: A repeating cycle where the system advances toward a goal, then reverses, ending up back where it started.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Cyclical advancement followed by regression
- Returns to starting state repeatedly
- Progress is temporary and unsustainable
- May involve pendulum swings between extremes

**Examples**:
- Company builds up capacity â†’ downsizes â†’ builds up â†’ downsizes
- Organization centralizes â†’ decentralizes â†’ centralizes again
- Person gains weight â†’ loses weight â†’ gains weight back
- Team improves performance â†’ performance degrades â†’ improves again

**Detection Questions**:
- Does this system show repeated cycles of progress and regression?
- Are there patterns of building up followed by tearing down?
- Does success in one area lead to problems that reverse the progress?
- Is there a pendulum swing between opposite approaches?

**Note**: Oscillation is a "terrible structure for personal life or for a company" but identifying it is neutral observation, not judgment.`;
}

function buildAdvancingDetectionPrompt(): string {
  return `ðŸŒŠ **ADVANCING/RESOLVING PATTERN DETECTION**

**Definition**: A structure that consistently moves from clearly defined current reality toward a desired outcome.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Driven by structural tension between current reality and desired outcome
- Progress builds on previous progress
- Movement is generally in one direction toward the goal
- Success creates momentum for continued advancement

**Mechanism**: 
- **Structural Tension**: Natural tendency for discrepancy between desired state and current state to seek resolution
- This tension is the creative force that generates advancing movement

**Examples**:
- Person learns skill â†’ practices â†’ gets better â†’ applies skill â†’ learns more
- Company identifies market need â†’ develops product â†’ sells â†’ reinvests in improvement
- Team sets clear goals â†’ makes progress â†’ celebrates success â†’ sets next goals
- System establishes feedback loops that reinforce desired behavior

**Detection Questions**:
- Is there clear structural tension between current reality and desired outcome?
- Does progress in one area support further progress?
- Are there feedback loops that reinforce advancement?
- Is the system generally moving toward a specific desired state?`;

**Analysis Framework**:

**Your Analysis Task**:

1. **Pattern Identification**: Based on the situation described, which pattern does this system exhibit?
   - Oscillation (cyclical progress/regression)
   - Advancing (consistent movement toward desired outcome)
   - Unclear (insufficient information or mixed patterns)

2. **Evidence Collection**: What specific evidence supports your pattern identification?
   - List concrete examples from the situation
   - Note behavioral cycles or progression sequences
   - Identify structural elements (tensions, feedback loops, etc.)

3. **Confidence Assessment**: How confident are you in this pattern identification? (1-10 scale)
   - What makes you confident?
   - What information would increase confidence?
   - What aspects remain unclear?

4. **Structural Analysis**: What underlying structure is generating this pattern?
   - What forces are creating the behavior?
   - What structural elements support or undermine advancement?
   - How could the structure be modified to produce different patterns?

5. **Implications**: What does this pattern mean for the system's future?
   - If oscillation: What keeps the system stuck in cycles?
   - If advancing: What supports continued advancement?
   - What would need to change for different outcomes?

**Remember**: This is diagnostic observation. The goal is to understand what IS, not immediately to change it.`;

**Deep Structural Investigation**:
Focus on the underlying structural elements that generate the observed behavior patterns.

**Core Principle**: Structure determines behavior. What you observe is the result of underlying structural forces.

**Structural Elements to Identify**:
1. **Forces**: What forces are acting on this system?
2. **Tensions**: What unresolved tensions exist?
3. **Feedback Loops**: What reinforces current patterns?
4. **Constraints**: What limits or directs behavior?
5. **Incentives**: What does the structure reward/punish?

**Key Questions**:
- What structural elements keep this pattern in place?
- If the pattern is oscillation, what structure creates the reversal?
- If the pattern is advancing, what structure maintains momentum?
- How could the structure be modified to produce different patterns?
