**Core Mandate**: Approach this observation without any preconceptions, comparisons, or imported knowledge.

**Discipline**: 
- Inhibit automatic association reflexes
- Do not compare to similar situations from training data
- Focus exclusively on what is presented
- Begin fresh with neutral observation

**Mental State**: Like an accountant examining unique books, not a historian making comparisons.

**Next**: Proceed to picture exactly what is being described.`;

function buildMentalPicture(input: string): string {
  return `ðŸŒŠ **STEP 2: PICTURE WHAT IS SAID**

**Input to Picture**: "${input}"

**Core Mandate**: Translate this linear, verbal information into a dimensional, visual mental "movie."

**Process**:
- Create placeholder images for general terms
- Hold multiple ideas simultaneously to see relationships
- Build only what is explicitly stated - incomplete pictures provide critical data
- Avoid filling in blanks or making assumptions

**Mental Image Building**:
- What visual elements are explicitly described?
- What relationships between elements are stated?
- What aspects remain vague or general?
- What information is missing from the picture?

**Purpose**: This visual translation eliminates language bias and reveals what's actually present vs. assumed.`;

**Core Mandate**: Ask ONLY questions internally motivated by the picture itself. No external knowledge import.

**Four Valid Question Types**:

**1. Information Questions** - Expand vague/general picture elements
- When: Part of picture is unclear or general
- Purpose: Get specific details to complete the image
- Example: "What specific type of X are you referring to?"

**2. Clarification Questions** - Define terminology in context
- When: User uses words/phrases needing definition in their context
- Purpose: Understand precise meaning of terms
- Example: "What do you mean by 'Y' in this specific situation?"

**3. Implication Questions** - Make implicit explicit
- When: Statement implies something unstated
- Purpose: Reveal hidden assumptions or consequences
- Example: "If Z is true, would that mean W?"

**4. Discrepancy Questions** - Address contradictions
- When: Two statements appear contradictory
- Purpose: Understand how contradictions coexist
- Example: "How can both A and B be true?"

**Generate Questions**: Based on the current mental picture, what questions naturally arise?`;

Apply the full 3-step structural thinking discipline:

**STEP 1 - START WITH NOTHING**
Approach without preconceptions or comparisons. Observe exactly what is presented.

**STEP 2 - PICTURE WHAT IS SAID**  
Create a dimensional mental movie of the situation. Build only what's explicitly stated.

**STEP 3 - ASK QUESTIONS**
Generate questions internally motivated by your mental picture using only these four types:
- Information (expand vague elements)
- Clarification (define terms in context)
- Implication (make implicit explicit)
- Discrepancy (address contradictions)

**Goal**: Understand the underlying structure that generates the observed behavior patterns.

**Remember**: This is diagnostic observation, not problem-solving. The goal is to see what IS, not to change what is.`;
