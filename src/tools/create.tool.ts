## Germination Energy
This is the exciting beginning phase of creation. Feel the possibility and energy of what you want to create.

### Vision Clarification:
- What does the completed creation look like specifically?
- What draws you to create this particular outcome?
- What aspects excite you most?
- What would success look and feel like?
- How will you know when it's complete?

### Initial Actions:
- What's one small step you could take today?
- What research or exploration would be helpful?
- What resources or connections might you need?
- Who else might be interested in this creation?

### Balance Planning and Action:
- Do some initial planning, but don't over-plan
- Take action alongside planning
- Let the vision guide you, not methodology
- Stay connected to what you want to create

**Remember:** This is about bringing something into being that you want to exist. Trust your creative instincts and the energy of this beginning phase.

## Structural Tension Map
**Vision:** ${config.desiredOutcome}
**Current Reality:** ${config.currentReality}
**Creative Tension:** The gap between vision and reality generates energy to move toward your desired outcome.

## Assimilation Process
The initial excitement may be settling, but this is where real creative work happens. You're internalizing the creative process.

### Structural Tension Work:
- Hold both vision AND current reality clearly in awareness
- Feel the natural tension - this is your creative power
- Notice how this tension wants to resolve toward your vision
- Trust that your mind will generate solutions

### Momentum Building:
- What actions are naturally emerging from this tension?
- What resources are becoming available?
- What connections or opportunities are appearing?
- What new insights are being generated?
- What coincidences or synchronicities are occurring?

### Progress Assessment:
- How is your vision becoming clearer and more specific?
- What aspects of the end result are starting to become visible?
- What course corrections are needed based on what you're learning?
- What's working well in your creative process?
- What obstacles are resolving naturally?

### Natural Movement:
- What feels like the natural next step?
- Where do you have the most energy and momentum?
- What would bring you closer to your desired outcome?
- What adjustments want to be made?

**Trust the Process:** Allow natural movement and useful coincidences to emerge. Your creative unconscious is working when structural tension is clearly established.

## Near-Completion Status
**Original Vision:** ${config.desiredOutcome}
**Current Progress:** ${config.currentReality}
**Phase:** Final stages of creative process

## Completion Guidance
Your creation is nearly complete. This phase has its own energy and requirements.

### Finishing Touches:
- What final details will bring this to full completion?
- What finishing touches would make this truly satisfying?
- What would make you proud to share this creation?
- What small refinements would perfect it?

### Completion Resistance Management:
- Resist urge to add unnecessary complexity
- Don't get distracted by new exciting projects
- Stay focused on completing what you started
- Recognize that completion anxiety is normal

### Quality Assessment:
- Does this creation fulfill your original vision?
- What aspects exceed your expectations?
- What would you do differently next time?
- What are you most proud of in this creation?

### Transition Preparation:
- How will you know when this is truly complete?
- What will it feel like to shift from creator to audience?
- How will you celebrate and appreciate what you've created?
- What new creative visions are emerging from this completion?

### Final Steps:
- What would bring this creative process to successful conclusion?
- What documentation or presentation does it need?
- Who would appreciate seeing this completed creation?
- How does this completion set you up for future creations?

**Complete the Cycle:** Finish this creation fully so you can appreciate what you've brought into being and be ready for your next creative adventure.

The creative process is about bringing desired outcomes into being, not solving problems or eliminating what you don't want.

**Instead of**: "I need to fix/solve/stop..."
**Try**: "I want to create/establish/bring into being..."

**Structural Shift**:
- **Reactive-Responsive**: Focus on what's wrong â†’ eliminate problems
- **Creative Orientation**: Focus on what you want â†’ manifest desired outcomes

**Question for Reframe**: What specific positive outcome do you want to create or bring into existence?

This shift moves you from reactive patterns (which often create oscillation) to creative patterns (which generate advancing structures).`;
