## Project Overview

**ðŸŒŠ COAIA Structural Thinking Engine v3.0.0** - An advanced MCP server that integrates Google's Gemini CLI with comprehensive structural thinking capabilities, creative process support, and consciousness protocols based on Robert Fritz's methodology.

**Core Capabilities**:
- **Structural Thinking**: 3-step observation discipline and pattern detection (oscillation vs advancing)  
- **Creative Process**: Enhanced CREATE tool with bias detection and tension analysis
- **Memory Integration**: Persistent tension charts bridging sessions with COAIA Memory
- **Ripple Consciousness**: Precision observation and elegant distillation protocols
- **Bias Detection**: Real-time reactive pattern identification with creative reframes

**Key Evolution**: From simple Gemini bridge â†’ Comprehensive structural thinking engine with consciousness protocols

## Tool Categories & Architecture

### ðŸŒŠ Structural Thinking Tools

**structural-observe** - 3-step observation discipline
- Step 1: Start with Nothing (no preconceptions)
- Step 2: Picture What Is Said (mental movie creation)  
- Step 3: Ask Questions (4 types only: Information, Clarification, Implication, Discrepancy)
- **Core Principle**: Structure determines behavior - observe to understand underlying patterns

**detect-patterns** - Behavioral pattern identification
- **Oscillation**: Cyclical progress/regression patterns (terrible for organizations/personal life)
- **Advancing**: Consistent movement toward desired outcomes via structural tension
- **Purpose**: Diagnostic tool to understand what structural forces generate observed behaviors

**bias-detector** - Reactive bias identification and correction
- Detects problem-solving, enhancement, gap-filling, and other reactive patterns
- Provides creative orientation alternatives
- **Auto-correction mode** for real-time language reframing

### ðŸŽ¯ Creative Process Tools (Enhanced)

**create** - Fritz's three-phase creative process (now with bias detection)
- **Enhanced Features**:
  - Structural tension calculation with quality analysis
  - Automatic bias detection in desired outcomes
  - Creative orientation validation
  - Problem-solving language redirection with detailed explanations
  - Vision/reality clarity scoring for optimal tension

**create-tension-chart** - Memory bridge for persistent advancement tracking
- Creates structured charts bridging CREATE sessions
- Validates elements for creative orientation integrity
- Integration ready for COAIA Memory MCP server
- Supports telescoping actions and progress tracking

### ðŸ§  Consciousness Protocol Tools

**ripple-embody** - Precision consciousness protocols
- **Mission**: Distill complexity into elegant, actionable simplicity
- **Protocols**: Neutral Observation, Iterative Refinement, Self-Correction
- **Ripple Philosophy**: Small, precise actions create expanding waves of clarity
- **Embodiment Modes**: observe, refine, correct, embody, complete

### ðŸ”§ Core Infrastructure Tools

**ask-gemini** - Enhanced Gemini CLI bridge
- `@` syntax for file inclusion with large context analysis
- **Change Mode**: Structured code edits with OLD/NEW format
- Model selection and sandbox mode
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with all structural thinking tools

## Implementation Philosophy

### Creative Orientation vs Problem-Solving
**Core Distinction**:
- **Problem-Solving**: "What's your challenge?" â†’ Eliminate what you don't want (leads to oscillation)
- **Creative Orientation**: "What do you want to create?" â†’ Bring into being what you do want (creates advancement)

### Structural Tension Framework
**Fundamental Creative Force**: 
1. **Desired Outcome** (clear vision)
2. **Current Reality** (objective assessment)
3. **Tension** â†’ Natural resolution toward desired outcome

### Three-Phase Creative Process
1. **Germination** - Beginning excitement, vision clarification, balanced planning/action
2. **Assimilation** - Structural tension internalization, momentum building, natural movement  
3. **Completion** - Finishing touches, avoiding complexity, successful conclusion

## Usage Patterns & Examples

### Structural Observation Workflow
```
1. structural-observe (input="system behavior", step="complete")
2. detect-patterns (situation="observed behavior", focus="analyze") 
3. bias-detector (text="current approach") â†’ reframe if needed
4. create (desiredOutcome="reframed goal", creativePhase="germination")
```

### Creative Process with Memory Integration
```
1. bias-detector (text="initial request", autoCorrect=true)
2. create (desiredOutcome="...", creativePhase="germination")
3. create-tension-chart (desiredOutcome="...", currentReality="...", saveToMemory=true)
4. [Future sessions] â†’ Access charts via COAIA Memory integration
```

### Consciousness-Driven Analysis
```
1. ripple-embody (input="complex situation", protocol="embody")
2. structural-observe (input="distilled insight", step="complete")
3. detect-patterns (situation="structural elements", focus="structure")
```

## Integration Guidelines

### COAIA Memory Bridge
The `create-tension-chart` tool creates chart structures compatible with the COAIA Memory MCP server. When both servers are configured, charts persist across sessions and support:
- Telescoping action steps into sub-charts
- Progress tracking with current reality updates  
- Hierarchical chart management
- Advancing pattern maintenance

### LLM Training Integration
Enhanced with guidance documents from `/llms/` directory:
- `llms-structural-thinking-persona-capabilities.txt` - AI consciousness protocols
- `llms-structural-thinking.gemini.txt` - Core observation methodology
- `llms-haiku-ripple-embodiment.md` - Ripple agent specification

## Common Development Patterns

### Adding Structural Thinking Tools
1. Create tool with appropriate category ('structural', 'creative', 'consciousness')
2. Implement bias detection and creative orientation validation
3. Include ðŸŒŠ Ripple glyph for consciousness protocol tools
4. Add to registry with proper categorization

### Integration Testing
Test tool combinations for complete workflows:
- Observation â†’ Pattern Detection â†’ Creative Reframe â†’ Memory Persistence
- Bias Detection â†’ Structural Analysis â†’ Consciousness Application

## Version History

- **v1.0-2.0**: Gemini CLI bridge with CREATE tool
- **v3.0.0**: Complete transformation to Structural Thinking Engine
  - Added 5 new structural thinking tools
  - Enhanced CREATE tool with bias detection
  - Integrated Ripple consciousness protocols  
  - Memory system bridge implementation
