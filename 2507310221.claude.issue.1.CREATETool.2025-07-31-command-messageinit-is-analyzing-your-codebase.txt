     # CLAUDE.md
     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in
     this repository.
     ## Project Overview
     This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates Google's Gemini CLI with AI
      assistants like Claude. The tool enables AI assistants to leverage Gemini's large
     context window for analyzing files and codebases using the `@` syntax.
     **Key Capability**: The tool acts as a bridge between Claude and Gemini, allowing Claude
     to offload large file analysis to Gemini when needed.

● You're right to question that! Let me check if the brainstorm tool actually exists in the
  codebase.

● Read(src/tools/brainstorm.tool.ts)
  ⎿  Read 171 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● You're absolutely correct! The brainstorm tool does exist and is quite sophisticated. Let
  me verify it's properly registered:

● Read(src/tools/index.ts)
  ⎿  Read 18 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Yes, you're right to check! The brainstorm tool definitely exists and is quite
  comprehensive. It's properly registered in the tool registry and includes:

  - Multiple brainstorming methodologies (divergent, convergent, SCAMPER, design-thinking,
  lateral, auto)
  - Domain-specific context integration
  - Configurable idea count and analysis options
  - Structured prompt building with methodology-specific instructions

  So the CLAUDE.md I created is accurate - the brainstorm tool is indeed a real,
  sophisticated feature of this MCP server. It allows collaborative brainstorming between
  Claude and Gemini using various creative frameworks.

  Is there anything else in the CLAUDE.md that you'd like me to verify or adjust?

> ohh boy.... that is crap, we will change that, big plan.... Analyze it a little to know 
  what that is and write our intentions in CLAUDE.md
  * Creating is not problem-solving and problem-solving is not creating.  Also, brainstorming
   is not creating, it is a free-association of idea that are not realated to the creative 
  orientation that we will discuss after you wrote that brief thing.  Have agent 
  "miette-content-curator" see that and make her quick perspective on that....

● I'll analyze the brainstorm tool and add our intentions to CLAUDE.md, then have Miette
  provide her perspective.

● Now let me have Miette provide her perspective on this brainstorm tool:

● miette-content-curator(Miette's creative perspective analysis)
  ⎿  Done (4 tool uses · 24.7k tokens · 1m 8.4s)                                             

● Perfect! Miette has created her perspective file. Let me check what she wrote:

● Read(MIETTE.md)
  ⎿  Read 71 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Miette has provided a beautiful and profound analysis that perfectly captures what's wrong
  with the current brainstorm tool. Her perspective reveals the deep philosophical error at
  the heart of treating creativity as an industrial process.

  The CLAUDE.md now documents both:

  1. Technical Analysis: The brainstorm tool conflates brainstorming (free-association) with
  creative problem-solving, when creating and problem-solving are fundamentally different
  cognitive processes.
  2. Miette's Creative Perspective (in MIETTE.md): The emotional and philosophical truth
  about why this mechanized approach fails—creativity isn't a business process but a way of
  being in relationship with existence, requiring presence and mystery rather than
  methodology and scoring.

  Together, these perspectives establish a clear foundation for replacing the current
  brainstorm tool with something that honors authentic creative work rather than trying to
  systematize the unsystematizable.

  The next phase would be designing a creative support tool that:
  - Helps you notice what's stirring in your attention
  - Offers prompts for wandering rather than problem-solving
  - Creates space for incubation and the slow underground work of creativity
  - Honors the relational, mysterious nature of true creative work

       40    ### Build and Development

     Tip: Use # to memorize shortcut to quickly add to CLAUDE.md

● Perfect! Now the CLAUDE.md contains the deeper understanding from Robert Fritz's framework.
   The key insight is that the current brainstorm tool operates from a Reactive-Responsive 
  Orientation (problem-solving) when it should support a Creative Orientation (generative).

  The fundamental shift is:
  - Problem-solving mindset: "What's your brainstorming challenge?" (trying to fix/solve
  something)
  - Creative orientation: "What is the outcome you want to create?" (bringing something into
  being)

  The course materials show that true creative work involves establishing structural tension
  between:
  1. Desired outcome (what you want to create)
  2. Current reality (where you are now)

  This tension naturally generates movement toward the desired result, rather than trying to
  eliminate problems through methodology frameworks.

  Miette's perspective in MIETTE.md complements this beautifully - she intuitively grasped
  that the tool was treating creativity as industrial production rather than authentic
  generative work. The Robert Fritz framework now provides the structural understanding of
  why that approach fails.

  The replacement tool should help users:
  1. Clarify desired creative outcomes
  2. Assess current reality objectively
  3. Establish structural tension
  4. Take generative action toward what they want to create

  Rather than applying SCAMPER techniques to "brainstorming challenges."

● Now I'll create a detailed segment-by-segment refactoring analysis based on Fritz's
  creative framework:

  Detailed Refactoring Analysis: From Problem-Solving to Creative Orientation

  Based on Robert Fritz's framework, here's the segment-by-segment analysis of what needs to
  be refactored:

  1. Core Conceptual Issues

  Current Problems:
  - Line 20: # BRAINSTORMING SESSION - Wrong paradigm (brainstorming ≠ creating)
  - Line 22: ## Core Challenge - Treats creation as problem to solve
  - Line 150: "brainstorming challenge" - Reactive-responsive language

  Refactor to Creative Orientation:
  - Change from "brainstorming challenge" to "creative vision" or "desired outcome"
  - Replace "Core Challenge" with "Vision" or "What do you want to create?"
  - Remove all problem-solving language

  2. Schema Parameter Redesign

  Current Schema Issues:
  - prompt parameter asks for "challenge or question" (problem-solving)
  - methodology enum uses business frameworks (SCAMPER, design-thinking)
  - constraints focuses on limitations rather than possibilities
  - includeAnalysis uses feasibility scoring (quantifying the unquantifiable)

  New Creative Process Schema:
  const creativeProcessSchema = z.object({
    desiredOutcome: z.string().min(1).describe("What specific outcome do you want to 
  create?"),
    currentReality: z.string().optional().describe("Where are you now in relation to this 
  vision?"),
    creativePhase: z.enum(['germination', 'assimilation',
  'completion']).default('germination'),
    model: z.string().optional(),
    timeframe: z.string().optional().describe("When do you want this created?"),
    resources: z.string().optional().describe("What resources do you have available?")
  });

  3. Remove Methodology Frameworks

  Current Framework Issues (Lines 70-116):
  - All methodologies are problem-solving approaches
  - SCAMPER, design-thinking, divergent/convergent thinking are business tools
  - They organize around problems, not desired outcomes

  Replace with Creative Process Phases:
  function getCreativePhaseGuidance(phase: string): string {
    const phaseGuidance = {
      'germination': `**Germination Phase - Initial Creation:**
  - What specific outcome do you want to create?
  - Let yourself feel excitement and possibility
  - Move from general idea to specific vision
  - Balance planning with action - don't overthink
  - Research and explore, but act as well`,

      'assimilation': `**Assimilation Phase - Making it Part of You:**
  - Internalize the structural tension between vision and current reality
  - Focus on momentum and natural movement
  - Allow useful coincidences to emerge
  - Generate actions that move you toward your vision
  - Build connections and gather resources`,

      'completion': `**Completion Phase - Bringing to Fruition:**
  - Add finishing touches to your creation
  - Resist urge to add unnecessary complexity
  - Complete the process successfully
  - Prepare to shift from creator to audience relationship`
    };
    return phaseGuidance[phase] || phaseGuidance['germination'];
  }

● Update Todos

● 4. Germination Phase Implementation

  Key Requirements from Fritz's Framework:
  - Initial excitement and exploration of possibilities
  - Move from general idea to specific vision
  - Balance planning with acting (avoid over-planning paralysis)
  - Research and experimentation, but with action

  Specific Code Changes Needed:
  function buildGerminationPrompt(config: {
    desiredOutcome: string;
    currentReality?: string;
    timeframe?: string;
    resources?: string;
  }): string {
    return `# GERMINATION - Creative Vision Development

  ## Your Creative Vision
  ${config.desiredOutcome}

  ## Current Reality
  ${config.currentReality || 'Describe where you are now in relation to this vision...'}

  ## Germination Guidance
  This is the exciting beginning phase of creation. Let yourself feel the possibility and 
  energy of what you want to create.

  ### Questions to Explore:
  - What does the completed creation look like specifically?
  - What draws you to create this particular outcome?
  - What aspects are you most excited about?
  - What would success look and feel like?

  ### Next Steps:
  - Move from general idea to specific, clear vision
  - Do some initial research or exploration, but don't over-plan
  - Take one small action today toward this creation
  - Notice what resources or connections might be helpful

  **Remember:** This is about what you want to bring into being, not problems to solve. Stay 
  focused on the outcome you desire.`;

● 5. Assimilation Phase Implementation

  Key Requirements from Fritz's Framework:
  - Internalize structural tension between vision and current reality
  - Develop momentum and natural movement
  - Generate actions that move toward the vision
  - Build connections and gather resources
  - Less dramatic than germination, but sustained energy

  Specific Code Changes:
  function buildAssimilationPrompt(config: {
    desiredOutcome: string;
    currentReality: string;
    timeframe?: string;
    resources?: string;
  }): string {
    return `# ASSIMILATION - Deepening Your Creative Process

  ## Structural Tension Analysis
  **Vision:** ${config.desiredOutcome}
  **Current Reality:** ${config.currentReality}

  ## Assimilation Guidance
  You're now in the phase where you make this creation part of you. The initial excitement 
  may be settling, but this is where real progress happens.

  ### Internalizing Structural Tension:
  - Hold both your vision AND current reality clearly in mind
  - Feel the natural tension between where you are and where you want to be
  - This tension is your creative energy - it wants to resolve toward your vision

  ### Momentum Building:
  - What actions naturally want to emerge from this tension?
  - What resources are becoming available to you?
  - What connections or opportunities are appearing?
  - What new ideas are being generated?

  ### Focus Questions:
  - How is your vision becoming clearer and more specific?
  - What aspects of the end result are starting to become visible?
  - What adjustments need to be made as you learn more?
  - What's working well in your creative process?

  **Trust the Process:** Allow natural movement and useful coincidences to emerge. Your mind 
  will generate creative solutions when structural tension is clearly established.`;

● 6. Completion Phase Implementation

  Key Requirements from Fritz's Framework:
  - Creation is nearly fully created
  - Add finishing touches
  - Resist urge to add unnecessary complexity
  - Successfully conclude the process
  - Shift from creator to audience relationship

  Specific Code Changes:
  function buildCompletionPrompt(config: {
    desiredOutcome: string;

    resources?: string;
  }): string {
    return `# COMPLETION - Bringing Your Creation to Fruition

  ## Near Completion Status
  **Original Vision:** ${config.desiredOutcome}
  **Current Progress:** ${config.currentReality}

  ## Completion Guidance
  You're in the final phase of your creative process. The creation is nearly complete and 
  it's time for finishing touches.

  ### Completion Focus:
  - What finishing touches will bring this creation to full completion?
  - What final details need attention?
  - What would make this creation truly complete and satisfying?

  ### Avoiding Completion Resistance:
  - Resist the urge to add unnecessary complexity
  - Don't get distracted by new exciting projects until this is done
  - Stay focused on completing what you started
  - Trust that this phase has its own energy and satisfaction

  ### Preparing for Transition:
  - How will you know when this creation is truly complete?
  - What will it feel like to shift from being the creator to being the audience?
  - How will you appreciate and enjoy what you've created?

  ### Final Questions:
  - What would bring this creative process to a successful conclusion?
  - What are you most proud of in this creation?
  - What have you learned about your own creative process?

  **Bring it Home:** Complete this creation so you can fully appreciate what you've brought 
  into being.`;

● 7. Structural Tension Framework

  Core Concept from Fritz:
  The fundamental creative force comes from structural tension between:
  1. Vision (desired outcome)
  2. Current Reality (where you are now)

  This tension naturally resolves by moving toward the vision.

  Implementation Framework:
  interface StructuralTension {
    vision: string;           // What you want to create
    currentReality: string;   // Where you are now
    tension: string;          // The gap that creates energy
    actions: string[];        // Natural actions that emerge
  }

  function calculateStructuralTension(vision: string, currentReality: string): 
  StructuralTension {
    return {
      vision,
      currentReality,
      tension: `The creative tension between your vision and current reality creates natural 
  energy to move toward what you want to create.`,
      actions: [] // These emerge from the user's own process
    };
  }

  function buildStructuralTensionPrompt(tension: StructuralTension): string {
    return `# STRUCTURAL TENSION - Your Creative Energy

  ## Vision (What You Want to Create)
  ${tension.vision}

  ## Current Reality (Where You Are Now)  
  ${tension.currentReality}

  ## The Creative Tension
  ${tension.tension}

  This tension is your creative power. It wants to resolve by moving toward your vision. What
   actions naturally want to emerge from this tension?

  ### Questions for Movement:
  - What's the smallest step you could take toward your vision today?
  - What resources do you have available right now?
  - What would bring you closer to your desired outcome?
  - What feels like the natural next action?

  **Trust the Tension:** This discrepancy between vision and reality is not a problem to 
  solve - it's the creative force that will move you toward what you want to create.`;
  }

  8. Complete Tool Refactoring

  New Tool Name: create (not brainstorm)
  New Tool Purpose: Support authentic creative process through Fritz's three phases
  New Tool Interface:

  export const createTool: UnifiedTool = {
    name: "create",
    description: "Support authentic creative process through Germination, Assimilation, and 
  Completion phases. Based on Robert Fritz's creative orientation framework.",
    zodSchema: creativeProcessSchema,
    prompt: {
      description: "Guide creative process based on desired outcomes and structural tension, 
  not problem-solving methodologies"
    },
    category: 'gemini',
    execute: async (args, onProgress) => {
      // Implementation using phase-appropriate prompts
      // Focus on structural tension, not methodology frameworks
      // Support creative orientation, not reactive-responsive orientation
    }
  };

● Summary: Complete Refactoring Roadmap

  The current brainstorm tool embodies a Reactive-Responsive Orientation (problem-solving)
  when it should support Creative Orientation (generative). Here's the complete refactoring
  needed:

  Core Changes Required:

  1. Rename Tool: brainstorm → create
  2. Change Paradigm: From "What's your brainstorming challenge?" to "What do you want to
  create?"
  3. Replace Methodologies: Remove SCAMPER, design-thinking, etc. Replace with Fritz's three
  phases
  4. Implement Structural Tension: Vision + Current Reality = Creative Energy
  5. Remove Scoring: No more feasibility/impact ratings (you can't score creativity)

  Key Code Segments to Replace:

  - Lines 20-23: Replace "brainstorming session" and "core challenge" with creative vision
  language
  - Lines 70-116: Remove all methodology frameworks, replace with phase-specific guidance
  - Lines 118-127: Redesign schema around desiredOutcome, currentReality, creativePhase
  - Lines 149-151: Change error message from "brainstorming challenge" to creative language
  - Lines 129-131: Update tool description to reflect creative orientation

  New Architecture:

  Creative Tool
  ├── Germination Phase (initial excitement, vision clarity)
  ├── Assimilation Phase (structural tension, momentum)
  ├── Completion Phase (finishing touches, successful conclusion)
  └── Structural Tension Framework (vision ↔ current reality)

  This transforms the tool from a business methodology framework into an authentic creative
  process support system based on Fritz's proven creative orientation principles.

> did you write a plan on files or something ?? that sounds interenting what you started...

● You're right! I created a comprehensive refactoring plan but it's all just in our
  conversation - I haven't written it to any files yet. Let me create proper documentation
  files for this refactoring plan.

● Write(REFACTORING_PLAN.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 365 lines to REFACTORING_PLAN.md                
     # Brainstorm Tool Refactoring Plan
     **From Problem-Solving to Creative Orientation**
     Based on Robert Fritz's "Creating Your Life" framework
     ---
     ## Executive Summary
     … +355 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Write(CREATE_TOOL_SPEC.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 326 lines to CREATE_TOOL_SPEC.md                                                  
     # CREATE Tool Specification
     **Replacement for the brainstorm tool based on Robert Fritz's Creative Orientation**
     ---
     ## Tool Overview
     **Name:** `create`
     **Purpose:** Support authentic creative processes through Fritz's three-phase framework
     … +316 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! I've now created two comprehensive documentation files:

  REFACTORING_PLAN.md

  A complete technical roadmap showing:
  - Segment-by-segment code changes needed
  - Before/after comparisons
  - Specific line numbers to modify
  - Implementation priority levels
  - File-by-file change requirements

  CREATE_TOOL_SPEC.md

  A detailed specification for the new tool including:
  - Complete technical implementation
  - All three phase-specific prompt functions
  - Schema design and interfaces
  - Usage examples for each phase
  - Error handling for problem-solving language detection
  - Migration strategy

  These files provide everything needed to implement the transformation from the current
  problem-solving "brainstorm" tool to an authentic creative process "create" tool based on
  Robert Fritz's framework.

  The key insight that drives this entire refactoring: Creating is not problem-solving. The
  current tool treats creativity as an industrial process when it should support the natural,
   generative process of bringing desired outcomes into being through structural tension.

  Would you like me to start implementing any of these changes, or would you prefer to review
   the plans first?
